    <p>I built this site with HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap, and also Node.js, ExpressJs for the server and routes, Socket.io for the Chat route. I will soon finish my project with React.js.</p>
    <p>With the Home page, I want to introduce myseft and give you a little bit informations about this site.</p>
    <p>The "Front-end" anh "Back-end" will give you some more about these promgraming languages. I will soon update more details so if anyone want to learn these languages, they can go to my site and learn. I think that gonna be another way for me to learn.</p>
    <p>You can give me some feedback at "Feedback" page</p>
    <p>I built the "Chat" page with socket.io, it have not been perfect yet, but you can try it buy open 2 browers and it 'll work.</p>
